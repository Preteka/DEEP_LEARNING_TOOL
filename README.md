Neural networks are a fundamental concept in machine learning, forming the backbone of many AI applications. However, understanding how inputs are transformed through layers using weights, biases, and activation functions can be challenging for beginners. To address this, a Figma-based interactive tool has been developed that allows users to visualize and experiment with neural network computations step by step. This tool provides an engaging, hands-on approach to learning neural network operations, making abstract concepts more tangible.

Features of the Tool:
Users can select the number of input and hidden layers according to their learning requirements.
Users can enter input values, weights, and biases for each neuron.
The tool performs weighted sum calculations for every neuron in the network.
Applies activation functions like Sigmoid or ReLU to compute neuron outputs.
Propagates values layer by layer through hidden layers to the final output.
Displays layer-wise calculations to help users understand how inputs are transformed.
Allows real-time experimentation: changing weights, biases, or inputs immediately updates the output.
Provides a clear visualization of neural network behavior, helping beginners grasp forward propagation.
